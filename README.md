# Text File Manual Review Helper Script
Linux Only
A quick and dirty python script to assist with manual review of text files.
The script lists all files in the current working directory (non-recursively),
when prompted, enter the path (full or relative to CWD) you would like to copy files too.
The script will then print the HEAD of each file to the terminal, and allows the user
to decide whether the file should be copied on a file-by-file bases.
